# MIPS32
This repository contains the implementation of a MIPS32 processor, meticulously designed and developed based on the principles outlined in the textbook "Computer Principles and Design in Verilog HDL" by Yamin Li. The project begins with a foundational understanding of MIPS32 processor features through the design of a single-cycle CPU. It then progressively enhances throughput with pipelining, expands the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with a floating-point unit (FPU), and culminates in a more complete CPU design incorporating caches and Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs). Each subproject serves as a significant milestone, providing a deep dive into understanding and building complex CPU architectures.
